This is DS Tower Defense, or the beginnings of it anyway.

The plan is to make a kick ass tower defense game.

BUILDING
========
To build this project, under linux follow the steps at http://www.palib.info/wiki/doku.php?id=day1#in_linux_we_trust
I setup my directory in /opt/devkitpro and it contains the PAlib with PAlib 080823, devkitpro b21, and libnds, dswifi and libfat.  I set my PAPATH to /opt/devkitpro/PAlib/lib and my DEVKITPRO to /opt/devkitpro

TODO
====

currently the application doesn't really work.  I attempted to add a feature which is not finished.  however you can see the start of what i tried.
The application will show a number of towers, and they are supposed to rotate to point at the cursor, but actually, they dont rotate at all.

I am currently rewriting the makefile and sources into C++ as I know the language better.
